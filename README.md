# 🚀 Mini Search Engine

Welcome to the **Mini Search Engine**—a sleek, Java-powered tool that turns your `.txt`, `.docx`, and `.pdf` files into a searchable treasure trove! Whether you're digging through notes, reports, or docs, this bad boy indexes your files and ranks them by relevance with a frequency-based scoring system. Built with **SOLID** principles, it’s modular, extensible, and ready to rock your document-searching world. Let’s get started! 🎉

## ✨ Features
- **File Support**: Indexes `.txt`, `.docx`, and `.pdf` files like a pro.
- **Smart Search**: Case-insensitive keyword search with ranked results based on word frequency.
- **SOLID Design**: Clean, maintainable code that’s easy to tweak or expand.
- **Actual File Names**: Shows real file names from your directory—no generic placeholders here!

## 🛠️ Prerequisites
Before you dive in, make sure you’ve got:
- **Java 8+**: The engine runs on Java (tested with Java 1.8).
- **Maven**: For dependency management and building the project.
- **Git**: To clone this repo.

## 🔥 Getting Started
### 1. Clone the Repository
Bring this powerhouse to your machine with a quick Git clone:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/mini-search-engine.git
cd mini-search-engine
```
(Replace `your-username` with your GitHub username once you host this repo!)

### 2. Check Out the Goodies
Inside, you’ll find:
```plaintext
mini-search-engine/
├── src/
│   ├── main/
│   │   ├── java/
│   │   │   ├── Main.java                # The entry point
│   │   │   ├── DirectoryFileReader.java # Reads .txt, .docx, .pdf
│   │   │   ├── InMemoryIndexer.java    # Builds the index
│   │   │   ├── ... (other files)
│   └── resources/                      # Optional logging config
├── pom.xml                             # Maven magic
└── README.md                           # This file!
```

### 3. Compile the Project
Fire up Maven to fetch dependencies (Apache POI, PDFBox, Log4j) and compile the code:
```bash
mvn clean compile
```
If you see `[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS`, you’re golden! 🌟

### 4. Run the Engine
Launch the search engine and start exploring your files:
```bash
mvn exec:java
```
Maven runs the `Main` class automatically (thanks to the exec-maven-plugin config).

## 🎮 How to Use It
### 1. Prep Your Files
Drop some `.txt`, `.docx`, and `.pdf` files into a directory (e.g., `C:\docs` or `/home/user/docs`).
Example files:
- `notes.txt`: "Java rules!"
- `report.pdf`: "Java Java code"
- `doc.docx`: "Java programming"

### 2. Enter the Directory Path
When prompted, type the full path to your directory (e.g., `C:\docs`) and hit Enter.
Boom, **Indexing complete!** 🚀

### 3. Search Away
Type a query (e.g., `java`) and press Enter.
Get ranked results like:
```plaintext
Results:
1. report.pdf (score: 2.0)
2. notes.txt (score: 1.0)
3. doc.docx (score: 1.0)
```
Keep searching or type `exit` to quit.

## 🧰 Dependencies
This project leans on some heavy hitters:
- **Apache PDFBox (2.0.27)**: For cracking open `.pdf` files.
- **Apache POI (5.2.3)**: For parsing `.docx` goodness.
- **Log4j 2 (2.17.1)**: For smooth logging (no more SimpleLogger warnings!).

All managed via Maven—check `pom.xml` for the full scoop.

## ⚡ Troubleshooting
- **"ClassNotFoundException: Main"?**
  - Ensure `Main.java` is in `src/main/java/`. Run `mvn clean compile` again.
- **Log4j Warning?**
  - The `log4j-core` dependency in `pom.xml` fixes this. Rebuild with `mvn clean compile`.
- **No Results?**
  - Double-check your directory path and file extensions (`.txt`, `.docx`, `.pdf` supported).

## 🛠️ Wanna Hack It?
- **Add More File Types**: Tweak `DirectoryFileReader`’s glob pattern (e.g., `{*.docx,*.pdf,*.txt,*.md}`) and add parsing logic.
- **Fancy Scoring**: Play with `FrequencyBasedSearcher` to tweak how scores are calculated.
- **Better Logs**: Drop a `log4j2.xml` in `src/main/resources/` for custom logging vibes.
